# Airbnb Clone

## Submission by Fortune Imonikhea Ugbodaga

This project is my submission for the Airbnb Clone task, with a deadline of Wednesday, 12th July, 2023.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented a clone of the Airbnb home page based on the provided design reference. The cloned implementation includes all the required features, such as displaying available homes in a grid view, detailed listing cards, clickable filters, the ability to like and unlike a listing, and optional integration of the "Show map" functionality.

## Description

For this project, I closely replicated the design of the Airbnb home page. Here are the key features I implemented:

- Displayed a grid view of available homes, just like the original Airbnb home page, providing users with a familiar layout.
- Each listing card includes essential details, such as the listing image(s), name, host, availability dates, cost per night, and average rating.
- Implemented a list of 15-20 filters for the listings, enabling users to refine their search based on various preferences. Each filter is clickable for easy selection.
- Users can like and unlike a listing, allowing them to save and manage their favorite listings.
- The buttons on the navigation bar, filters, and footer are not functional or clickable, as specified in the task requirements.
- I mocked the necessary data and did not require any API connections for this project.

Optional Extras:

As an additional challenge, I successfully integrated the "Show map" functionality from the Airbnb home page. This feature provides users with a map view of the listings, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Reflection

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot throughout the process. It was challenging to replicate the Airbnb home page's design and functionality, but it provided a great opportunity to improve my frontend development skills.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit this project. I look forward to receiving feedback and further improving my skills.

Best regards,
